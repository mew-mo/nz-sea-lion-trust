          <h5>1993, a miracle comes to NZ!</h5>

          <p>Early on a warm summer morning in 1993 farmer George MacIntosh stepped out the front door of his farm near Taieri Mouth, Dunedin. Hearing a cry he thought was a kid goat he followed the sound and found something unique. It was a sea lion mother nursing a pup! George was amazed and phoned the Department of Conservation. After a site visit DOC Rangers soon confirmed it was indeed a female New Zealand sea lion, and the pup was quite likely the first one to be born on the mainland in over 150 years.</p> <br>

          <p>Mum, as this sea lion became known, had been born and tagged in the Auckland Islands but had travelled 600 km to the mainland to have her pup. She went on to give birth to 11 pups in the Dunedin area, re-establishing a breeding population on the mainland.</p><br>

          <p>Last seen in 2010 aged 24, she was a local icon and a living legend. Although Mum herself is no longer with us you have a very good chance of seeing one of Mum’s sons, daughters, grandpups or great grandpups along the Otago coastline.</p> <br>
          <p>Mum’s legacy continues to this day. The mainland population remains small but is growing with somewhere between 10 and 20 pups born here each year.</p><br>

          <p>A native treasure has returned!</p>

          <h5>10 metres is the safe minimum distance to view sea lions.</h5>
          <p>Walking along beaches in the Otago and Southland area you may come across individual or groups of sea lions. This is a thrilling experience but it is very important to <span class="bold">keep a distance of at least 10 metres</span> between you and the nearest sea lion for both your own and the sea lion’s safety.</p><br>

          <p>Dogs must be controlled by leads within 20 metres of sea lions.</p><br>

          <p>Sea lion pups and yearlings can be very inquisitive and at times can approach people out of interest. If this happens, back away slowly, never run. Try to be as uninteresting as you possibly can!</p><br>

          <p>Whilst numbers of sea lions are increasing on the New Zealand mainland, their numbers are still thought be below 300 so it is a privilege for us to be sharing our beaches and coastline with them.</p>
